It's designed to guide the reader through various steps in the event of an electric shock. The chart is set against a white background with black text and lines connecting different elements of the chart.\n\nThe flowchart begins at the top with a question: \"What is the type of electric shock?\", leading down to two possible outcomes: \"Low current, low voltage\" or \"High current, high voltage\". From there, depending on the severity of the shock, one would follow either a \"General\" path or a more specific \"Heart massaging\" path.\n\nThe \"General\" path leads to three steps: 1) \"Turn off electricity\", 2) \"Wait for a trained medical professional\", and 3) \"Stay calm\". The \"Heart massaging\" path, on the other hand, has two steps: 1) \"Use defibrillator\", and 2) \"CPR if necessary\".\n\nEach step is accompanied by corresponding actions, such as \"Call 911\", \"Use an AED\", or \"Perform CPR\". The chart provides a clear and concise guide on how to respond to an electric shock. It's important to note that the chart is purely fictional and meant for comedic effect.

The first box contains the text \"Electric Shock\". The second box connects to it and is labeled \"The next step is to call for medical assistance\". \n\nFrom this second box, three more boxes branch off. Each of these boxes represents a different action that can be taken after calling for medical assistance: \"Perform CPR\", \"Perform First Aid\", and \"Perform Mouth-to-Mouth Resuscitation\". These actions are connected by lines to the main electric shock box, indicating they are all part of the same process. \n\nThe chart is a clear and concise guide on how to respond in case of an electric shock, emphasizing the importance of immediate medical assistance.
